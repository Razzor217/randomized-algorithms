# randomized-algorithms

A collection of randomized algorithms that save computation time with randomness, for example by sampling.

## Currently implemented

* Matrix identity tests, i.e. whether A * B is equal to matrix C (singular test and monte-carlo variant)

## Build

To build this project, simply run `cmake` and `make` in your build directory, i.e.

```bash
# currently at project root
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Planned features

* And-Or-trees (in progress) for adversarial games
